# Web Scraping for the The Publication, Printing and Distribution Authority of Viet Nam

This is a simple web scraping application built with Python. It allows you to scrape data about a specific work and save it into an Excel file.

## How to Use

1. **Download and Run the `.exe` File**  
   Download the executable file and run it on your system.

2. **Input the Title**  
   Enter the title of the work you want to scrape when prompted.

3. **Create and Save an Excel File**  
   Specify the Excel file where the scraped data will be saved.

4. **Monitor Progress**  
   You can monitor the scraping progress in the terminal running in the background. Once the process is completed, the app will automatically open the Excel file containing the scraped data.

## Notes

Yes, it is agonizingly slow, as I was learning web scraping and other basic appdev through this app with python. Future updates to be more efficient are expected. If you have any suggestion for new feature, please kindly do so.
## Roadmap

- Optimize web scraping for faster performance.
- Enhance user interface and error handling.
- Add support for additional data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).

Thank you for using this app, and happy scraping!
